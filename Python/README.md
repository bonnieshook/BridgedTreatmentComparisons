# Fusing Trial Data for Treatment Comparisons: Single versus Multi-Span Bridging

---

## Python code for simulations and applied example

Simulations were completed using Python 3.9.5 with the following packages
- NumPy : v1.23.4
- SciPy : 1.9.3
- Pandas : 1.5.1
- Delicatessen : 1.1

## Manifest

`dgm.py` : functions for the data generating mechanisms for the simulation experiments

`efuncs.py` : estimating functions for estimators in simulations and applied example

`example.py` : recreates the applied example (results provided as comment)

`metrics.py` : functions for the computing performance metrics for the simulation experiments

`run_sims.py` : recreates the simulation experiments (results provided as comment)
